A curated collection of papers, technical reports, frameworks, and tools for on-policy distillation (OPD) of large language models.

> **On-policy distillation** trains a student on samples from its own evolving policy, while a teacher (external, privileged, or self-conditioned) provides dense supervision on those same samples.

OPD sits between supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Unlike off-policy KD, the student trains on its *own* generations, closing the train-inference distribution gap. Unlike RL, the student receives dense token-level teacher guidance rather than sparse rewards.

As of 2026, OPD is a standard post-training primitive at Alibaba (Qwen3), Xiaomi (MiMo), Zhipu (GLM-5), NVIDIA (Nemotron-Cascade 2), and others.

### Speculative Decoding (Draft-Model Training)

Draft-model training for speculative decoding shares OPD's core loop: the draft (student) generates, the target (teacher) verifies, and the draft is updated to match. Included for breadth even though the goal is inference acceleration rather than student capability.

## Acknowledgments

This list draws on the parallel curation effort at [thinkwee/AwesomeOPD](https://github.com/thinkwee/AwesomeOPD), which provided pointers to several papers (notably the speculative-decoding draft-model training, BoN distillation, self-play, and additional industrial reports) that broadened the scope of this list. The two lists are organized differently — thinkwee/AwesomeOPD groups by feedback signal and access mode; this list groups by methodological role — and are best read together.
